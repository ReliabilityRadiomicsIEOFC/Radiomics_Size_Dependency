# Discrimination of Tumor Texture Based on MRI Radiomic Features: Is There a Volume Threshold? A Phantom Study

## This study provides quantitative data about the loss of informative content of MRI radiomic features when calculated on small volumes. Besides providing useful information for the design of MRI radiomic studies in the pelvic region, it proposes a methodology that might be replicated for other imaging modalities and clinical scenarios upon the development of suitable phantoms.
